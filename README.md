Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aesha *(EY-shuh)* -- a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech (concentrations in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence) with a minor in Law, Science, & Technology. <br>

I mostly build with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS, but I also love learning new languages/stacks (currently working on C/C++!). 

More details about my experience & projects can be found on my portfolio, [https://aeshashah726.github.io/](https://aeshashah726.github.io/). ðŸš€âœ¨
